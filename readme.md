# Manhattan

Manhattan is a clean, lightweight and customisable CSS grid.

Manhattan uses it's own data attributes to keep your class markup clean. It features three different containers for constrained, flexible and edge-to-edge layouts. Manhattan doesn't use a traditional 12 column layout, but instead opts for straight forward percentages. It's also equipped with five optional breakpoints for total control over your layout. It's lightweight at 2410 bytes minified and 589 bytes gzipped.

For examples and usage instructions, please see the Manhattan website (coming soon).

Manhattan should be compatible with nearly all browsers, including IE8 with the help of a media query polyfill. However, if you do run into any errors using it, please let me know.

## Todo & Possible Future Features

* Release the first stable version
* Make a Sass version
